  <p class="tagline">A Community Rental Space<br>Available May to September</p>
  <p>Are you looking for the ideal location for celebrating a birthday, holding a reunion, hosting a baby shower or having the perfect wedding from ceremony to reception to dance?</p>
  <p>With fully equipped facilities built to compliment the character and charm of the Old Dance Hall, this idyllic setting can accommodate a wide variety of events.</p>
  <p>Nestled in a wooded glen where the Stanley hills meet the Nashwaak River, this collection of historic and newer buildings provides a beautiful settling for a variety of functions.  Everything from a small intimate lunch to a weekend long school or family reunion can be accommodated.  The grounds surrounding the buildings provide ample space for parking as well as a secluded area with lots of room for children and pets to run and play.</p>
  <p>The “Root House” Complex is fully equipped with kitchen facilities, a bright 60 seat dining room, an outdoor deck, a covered verandah and wheel chair accessible washroom facilities.</p>
  <p>The Old Dance Hall is the jewel of the facility.  Built well over 100 years ago as the dance hall for the Stanley Fair the fine craftsmanship is evident everywhere.  In recent years the original stage has been expanded to accommodate either a large band, a DJ with sound and light equipment or a live show.  Seating can be set up in front or to the sides of the stage, leaving a large area for a dance floor.</p>
  <p>These buildings are connected by a wide covered verandah and are wheel chair accessible.</p>
  <p>For those planning an event with several out of town guests there is space available for rough camping.</p>
